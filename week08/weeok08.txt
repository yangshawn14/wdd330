Definition 
**********
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

Structure 
**********
JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots: Header, Payload, and Signature.

Header 
**********
Contains metadata about the type of token and the signing algorithm used.

Payload 
**********
Contains the claims or statements about the entity (user) and additional data.

Signature 
**********
Created by encoding the header, payload, and a secret key using the specified algorithm. 
It ensures the integrity of the token and allows verification of its authenticity.

Develop, Debug, Learn
---------------------
Here are the key points from the speech:

1. Evolution of Web Development
*******************************
HTML to JavaScript transition.
JavaScript enabled interactivity.

2. JavaScript Empowerment
*******************************
Enabled creation of interactive experiences.
Led to a shift away from web development as a profession.

3. Abstractions and Frameworks
*******************************
Dependency on abstractions, frameworks, and libraries increased.
Understanding of underlying technologies diminished.

4. Debugging Challenges
*******************************
Initial lack of debugging tools.
Improvement with tools like Firebug and browser developer tools.

5. Dependency Management
*******************************
Build processes and package managers like npm emerged.
Addressed challenges in managing dependencies.

6. Overreliance on Frameworks
*******************************
Trend of excessive reliance on frameworks criticized.
Can result in code bloat and performance issues.

7. Focus on End Users
*******************************
Emphasis on delivering accessible, performant, and secure applications.
End users should be the primary focus.

8. Legacy Code and Maintenance
*******************************
Legacy code often neglected and unmaintained.
Poses challenges for future developers and user experience.

9. Holistic Developer Tools
*******************************
Need for integrated tools encompassing learning, documentation, linting, and debugging.
Tools should facilitate efficient development workflows.

10. Automation and Open Source
*******************************
Embrace automation and open-source collaboration.
Make development more accessible and empower developers to create better experiences for users.

These points emphasize the need for a balanced approach to web development, focusing on user needs, 
continuous learning, and leveraging tools effectively while remaining mindful of code quality and performance.
