Basic Usability Principles
--------------------------
Learnability: How easily first-time users complete basic tasks.  
Efficiency: How quickly users perform basic tasks once they’ve learned the design.
Memorability: The ability of users to remember how to use the system.
Errors: The amount and severity of errors users make and how easily they can correct them.
Satisfaction: How pleasant the experience of using the design was.

10 Mobile UX Design Principles
------------------------------
1. Content Prioritization
    - Simple Design is best. Less is MORE.
    - Display only the essential content and funcitons
    - Use icons instead of text when possible
2. Make Navigation Intuitive
    - Learnability of your design is key!
    - Users should understand the mapping of design.
3. Touchscreen Target Sizes
    - Apple:  44 pixels wide x 44 pixels tall.
    - Microsoft: 
            - Suggested: 9mm/34px
            - Min: 7mm/26px
    - Not only is the size of the target important, but so is the spacing between targets.
4. Provide User Control
    - Allow users to personalize the app
    - Changing settings, controlling notifications and cancelling actions provides 
    the user with a sense of control over the system
5. Legible Text Content
    - balance between legibility and space conservation
    - smaller than 16 pixels (or 11 points) becomes challenging to read
    - rule of thumb is to use 30–40 characters per line 
6. Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible
    -  WC3’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines gives contrast ratio 
    recommendations for images and text
7. Hand Position Controls
    - actions such as delete buttons should be placed in areas harder to reach to avoid errors
8. Minimize Data Input
    - minimize the NEED to enter data
    - provide shortcuts like autofill/complete, 'Remember Me,' and etc.
9. Create a Seamless Experience
    - Focus on key user goals by reducing friction
    - Make content accessible even without an online connection
    - Make use of the mobile phone’s features, like the camera to scan barcodes,
    GPS for identifying locations and touch ID in place of passcodes to simplify journeys.
    - Synchronization across devices is a key priority
10. Test Your Design
    - Continuously test and optimize
    - The earlier you discover your problems, the easier and cheaper it is to fix them.
